                of Service, and may be terminated by BUDDIES COMMERCIAL LLC at any time.</p>

                over content you submit to us for publication on our website. We will never claim ownership of your
                content, but we do require a license from you in order to use it. When you use our website or its
                associated services to post, upload, share, or otherwise transmit content covered by intellectual
                property rights, you grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide
                license to use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly display, translate, or otherwise create
                derivative works of your content in a manner that is consistent with your privacy preferences and our
                Privacy Policy. The license you grant us can be terminated at any time by deleting your content or
                account. However, to the extent that we (or our partners) have used your content in connection with
                commercial or sponsored content, the license will continue until the relevant commercial or post has
                been discontinued by us. You give us permission to use your username and other identifying information

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 text-justify mb-4">Our website and the materials on our website are provided
                on an ‘as is’ basis. To the extent permitted by law, BUDDIES COMMERCIAL LLC makes no warranties,
                expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without
                limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
                non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of rights. In no event shall BUDDIES
                COMMERCIAL LLC or its suppliers be liable for any consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any
                third party arising from the use or inability to use this website or the materials on this website, even
                if BUDDIES COMMERCIAL LLC or an authorized representative has been notified, orally or in writing, of
                the possibility of such damage. In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any
                consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue,
                loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of
                use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity, tort (including
                negligence), indemnity or otherwise. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
                warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may
                not apply to you.</p>
