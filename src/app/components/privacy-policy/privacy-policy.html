            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 text-justify mb-4">OON SOFT LLC values your privacy and is committed to
                protecting your personal information. We collect information voluntarily provided by you such as your
                name, email, billing details, and communications, as well as information collected automatically
                including IP address, browser type, device details, log data, cookies, and tracking technologies. This
                information is used to deliver and improve our services, process payments securely through payment
                gateways such as Stripe and PayPal, provide customer support, conduct analytics, prevent fraud, and send
                marketing communications where permitted. We retain account data while accounts remain active, billing
                and transaction data for at least seven years to comply with legal requirements, and log data for
                shorter periods unless needed for security or legal purposes. We do not sell personal data; however, we
                may share information with payment processors, hosting providers, analytics services, advertising
                networks, and legal authorities if required. Trusted third-party providers such as Google Analytics or
                Facebook Pixel may also set cookies or track browsing behavior to support analytics and marketing;
                details about these technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy, and you may opt out through your
                browser settings or consent manager. If you access our services outside the United States, your
                information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S. with safeguards such as GDPR Standard
                Contractual Clauses. You have the right to request access, correction, or deletion of your data, as well
                as the right to opt out of certain processing or marketing communications, and rights under GDPR or CCPA
                may apply. To exercise your rights, please contact us at support@oonsoft.llc with the subject line
                “Privacy Request”; we may verify your identity before fulfilling your request. In the event of a data
                breach affecting your personal information, we will notify you in accordance with applicable laws,
                typically within 72 hours, and provide information on any recommended protective measures. Our services
                are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect their information. We use
                encryption, secure servers, and access controls to protect your data, but no system is entirely secure.
                This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, and significant changes will be posted on our
                website with a revised effective date.</p>
